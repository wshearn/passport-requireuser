# passport-requireuser

[Passport](http://passportjs.org/) strategy for authentication that just checks req.user.

## Install

    $ npm install passport-requireuser

## Usage

This is if you want to mix and match basic and local auth. Like if you are 
making an API and you want people to be able to set the Authorization header 
or if you want them(or your code) to access the api while logged into a web 
browser.
